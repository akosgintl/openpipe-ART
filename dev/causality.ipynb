      "Okay, let's try to solve this mystery step by step. There's a lot of information here, so I need to organize it carefully. Let me start by listing all the clues and see which ones are most critical.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the suspects are Miss Peach, Mr. Green, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White, Monsieur Brunette, Miss Scarlet, Professor Plum, Colonel Mustard. The weapons include Poison, Wrench, Knife, Rope, Horseshoe, Revolver, Lead Pipe, Candlestick. The rooms are numbered 01 to 10. The times are 10:30 PM, 11:00 PM, 11:30 PM, 12:00 AM, 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder must have happened in a room where the murderer and Mr. Boddy were alone with a weapon. Also, movement between adjacent rooms is allowed each time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me start by noting the times when Mr. Boddy was in specific rooms:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 11:30 PM: Gazebo\n",
      "- 11:00 PM: Courtyard\n",
      "- 12:30 AM: Gazebo\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:30 PM (clue says \"Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:30 PM\").\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if the murder happened at 11:30 PM, the room was Gazebo. But maybe the murder happened at another time. Wait, but the murderer and Mr. Boddy must have been alone in a room with at least one weapon at some point. The time of the murder could be any of the given times, but we need to find out which.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the clues:\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with the ones that mention specific times and positions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue: Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:30 PM and 11:00 PM (but wait, another clue says Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:30 PM, then at 11:00 PM he was in Courtyard? Wait, no, let me check:\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue: Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM (from first bullet point). Also, another clue says \"Mr. Boddy was in the Courtyard at 10:30 PM\". So he was in Courtyard at 10:30 PM and then at 11:00 PM. But that's possible if he didn't move. Or maybe he moved? Wait, the movement is allowed between adjacent rooms. Let me note that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM. That's a key clue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue: Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 10:30 PM. (from \"Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 10:30 PM\"). Also, the Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM. And the Knife was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM. Wait, Lead Pipe and Knife in Cloak Room at 10:30 PM?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the clue says \"The Knife was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM\" and \"The Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM.\" So both weapons were there at that time. Also, the clue says \"The Lead Pipe and the Horseshoe were in the Cloak Room together at least once.\" But since the Lead Pipe is in Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, and the Horseshoe's location at that time? Let me check.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue: Colonel Mustard was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 10:30 PM. So Horseshoe was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30 PM. Also, Colonel Mustard was in the room just north of Monsieur Brunette at 10:30 PM. Let me see the room layout.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms are laid out as:\n",
      "\n",
      "W 01|02|03 E\n",
      "\n",
      "W 04|05|06 E\n",
      "\n",
      "W 07|08|09 E\n",
      "\n",
      "W 10|-|- E\n",
      "\n",
      "So 01 is Study, 02 Carriage House, 03 Conservatory, 04 Lounge, 05 Hall, 06 Courtyard, 07 Billiard Room, 08 Cloak Room, 09 Gazebo, 10 Kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the rooms are arranged in a grid. For example, room 01 (Study) is north of 04 (Lounge), which is north of 07 (Billiard Room). Room 10 (Kitchen) is south of 07, 08, 09? Wait, the layout is:\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 1: 01 02 03\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 2: 04 05 06\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 3: 07 08 09\n",
      "\n",
      "Row 4: 10 - -\n",
      "\n",
      "So the adjacency is such that each room (except for edges) can be north/south/east/west.\n",
      "\n",
      "So for Colonel Mustard being in a room just north of Monsieur Brunette at 10:30 PM. So if Colonel Mustard is in a room, then Monsieur Brunette is in a room just south of that. For example, if Colonel Mustard is in 01 (Study), Monsieur Brunette is in 04. Or Colonel Mustard in 04 (Lounge), Monsieur Brunette in 07 (Billiard Room), etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, Colonel Mustard was in the same room as the Horseshoe at 10:30 PM. And the Horseshoe was in the same room as Lead Pipe and others at some point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important clue: The murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM. So the murder weapon was in Conservatory (room 03) at 10:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the Candlestick was in the Billiard Room at 10:30 PM. (clue: \"The Candlestick was in the Billiard Room at 10:30 PM\")\n",
      "\n",
      "But the murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM, which may be different from the Candlestick. Wait, the murder weapon is one of the 8 weapons. So the murder weapon could be any, but at 10:30 PM, a specific weapon (the murder weapon) was in the Conservatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue: The Revolver and the Candlestick were in the Billiard Room together at least once. So at some time, both Revolver and Candlestick were in the Billiard Room. Since the Candlestick was in Billiard Room at 10:30 PM, maybe the Revolver was there too? But that's not stated yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's look for contradictions and build a timeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with 10:30 PM:\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Boddy was in Courtyard (room 06) at 10:30 PM. (as per given)\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue: Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen (room 10) at 10:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Clue: The Lead Pipe and the Horseshoe were in the Cloak Room (room 08) together at least once. Also, Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, and the Knife was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM. Colonel Mustard was in the same room as Horseshoe at 10:30 PM. Therefore, Horseshoe is in same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30 PM. Since Lead Pipe and Horseshoe are in Cloak Room together (at least once), and Horseshoe was in same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30, that implies that Colonel Mustard was in the Cloak Room (room 08) at 10:30 PM, because Lead Pipe and Horseshoe were there, and Colonel Mustard is with Horseshoe. Therefore, Colonel Mustard was in room 08 (Cloak Room) at 10:30 PM. Also, Colonel Mustard was in the room just north of Monsieur Brunette at 10:30 PM. Since room 08 is Cloak Room, the room just south of it would be... but the layout has room 10 (Kitchen) below room 07, 08, 09. So room 08 (Cloak Room) is in row 3 (third row) which is just north of row 4 (room 10). Therefore, the room just south of 08 is room 10 (Kitchen). So if Colonel Mustard is in room 08 (north of Monsieur Brunette), then Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (Kitchen) at 10:30 PM. But Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen (room 10) at 10:30 PM. Therefore, someone else is in the Kitchen? Wait, unless the same person is both Mrs. Peacock and Monsieur Brunette? That can't be. So this is a contradiction? Wait, because Colonel Mustard was in room 08 (Cloak Room) at 10:30 PM, north of Monsieur Brunette (room 10). But Mrs. Peacock was also in room 10 at 10:30 PM. Therefore, Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (Kitchen) at 10:30 PM, making room 10 occupied by both Mrs. Peacock and Monsieur Brunette? Unless they are the same person, which they are not (since the suspects are listed as separate). Therefore, this suggests that my previous conclusion is wrong. Maybe Colonel Mustard is not in room 08 at 10:30 PM?\n",

      "\n",
      "- The Horseshoe was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30 PM.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if Horseshoe and Colonel Mustard were together at 10:30 PM, then Colonel Mustard must have been in the Cloak Room (room 08) at that time, since the Horseshoe was in the Cloak Room (with Lead Pipe and Knife) at 10:30 PM? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, the Horseshoe could have been in the Cloak Room at another time, but if Lead Pipe and Horseshoe were in the Cloak Room together at least once, and Lead Pipe was there at 10:30 PM, then Horseshoe was there at 10:30 PM or earlier. But Colonel Mustard was with Horseshoe at 10:30 PM. Therefore, if Horseshoe was in Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, then Colonel Mustard is there too. Therefore, Colonel Mustard was in Cloak Room (room 08) at 10:30 PM. Therefore, his position is room 08. Then, since he was in a room just north of Monsieur Brunette, Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (south of 08). But room 10 is Kitchen, where Mrs. Peacock was at 10:30 PM. So that would mean Monsieur Brunette is in the Kitchen, same as Mrs. Peacock. Unless there's a mistake here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but maybe Horseshoe wasn't in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM. The clue says \"Lead Pipe and the Horseshoe were in the Cloak Room together at least once\"—could have been at a different time. However, the Lead Pipe was in Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, but the Horseshoe could have been in the Cloak Room at an earlier or later time. However, the clue says that at 10:30 PM, Colonel Mustard was in the same room as the Horseshoe. Therefore, Horseshoe must be in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30 PM. But if the Horseshoe is not in the Cloak Room at that time, then where is it?\n",

      "Alternatively, maybe the Horseshoe was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 10:30 PM, which is not Cloak Room.

      "\n",
      "But the problem here is that if the Horseshoe was not in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, then Colonel Mustard is with Horseshoe someplace else. However, we know that the Lead Pipe was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, and that the Lead Pipe and Horseshoe were together in that room at least once. So the Horseshoe must have been in the Cloak Room at least once. If at 10:30 PM, the Horseshoe is not in the Cloak Room, then it must have been there at another time. However, the clue about Colonel Mustard and Horseshoe being together at 10:30 PM implies that Horseshoe was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at that time. But if Horseshoe is not in the Cloak Room, then Colonel Mustard is not in the Cloak Room, but in another room where Horseshoe is. However, that would mean the Lead Pipe was in Cloak Room (room 08) at 10:30 PM, but Horseshoe was not there, which would require Horseshoe and Lead Pipe to have been together in Cloak Room at another time. That's possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this seems complicated. Let me try another approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's consider the Lead Pipe and Horseshoe being in the Cloak Room together. Suppose they were both in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM. Then, the Horseshoe was in Cloak Room (room 08). Colonel Mustard was with Horseshoe at 10:30 PM, meaning he was also in room 08. Then, he was in room 08, which is north of room 10 (Kitchen). Therefore, Monsieur Brunette was in room 10. But room 10 was occupied by Mrs. Peacock. But that's impossible unless they are the same person, which they are not. Therefore, this would be a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that Horseshoe and Lead Pipe were together in Cloak Room at 10:30 PM must be wrong. Hence, they were in the Cloak Room together at another time, and at 10:30 PM, the Horseshoe was elsewhere with Colonel Mustard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the Horseshoe was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM, but that would mean Colonel Mustard is also in the Cloak Room (room 08), but then Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (Kitchen), same as Mrs. Peacock. Which is conflicting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen (room 10) at 10:30 PM. So the person who was in the Kitchen (room 10) at 10:30 PM is Mrs. Peacock. If Monsieur Brunette was also there, that would mean two people in the same room, which is allowed. Wait, but the problem says that the suspects are in their current room or move to an adjacent room each time. But if they are in the same room, that's possible. So perhaps Mrs. Peacock and Monsieur Brunette were both in the Kitchen at 10:30 PM? But the clue says \"Mrs. Peacock was in the Kitchen at 10:30 PM\" but doesn't say anything about Monsieur Brunette being there. So that's possible. So maybe that's acceptable. So if Colonel Mustard was in room 08 with Horseshoe at 10:30 PM (because Horseshoe is in Cloak Room with Lead Pipe and Knife), then that's okay. And Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (south of 08). But room 10 has Mrs. Peacock. So it's possible that Monsieur Brunette is in room 10 (with Mrs. Peacock). But then both are in the same room. The problem doesn't say that the suspects had to be alone, unless during the murder time. So this might be acceptable. Therefore, this may not be a contradiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, proceeding with that, Colonel Mustard is in room 08 (Cloak Room) at 10:30 PM with Horseshoe, while Lead Pipe is also in room 08 (Cloak Room) at that time. Then, the Lead Pipe and Horseshoe are in the same room (Cloak Room) at 10:30 PM, fulfilling the clue that they were in the Cloak Room together at least once.\n",

Let's check possible paths from 03 to 09. Room 03 is Conservatory. Room 03 is connected to room 02 (Carriage House) and room 06 (Courtyard). Room 06 is connected to 05 and 09. So a possible path would be 03→02→01→04→07→08→09... but that seems complicated.

      "\n",
      "But let's look for clues that indicate the murder happened at a specific time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue about the murder weapon being in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM: if that room is where the murderer was, and also where Mr. Boddy was, but at 11:00 PM, Mr. Boddy was in Courtyard, so that seems unlikely unless the murderer was in Courtyard with a weapon at 11:00 PM. But the murder weapon was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM. So if the murderer is Colonel Mustard, and he had the weapon with him, and he was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at some time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is too vague. Let me think about the clues involving specific movements.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 12:30 AM, Professor Plum moves the murder weapon from Gazebo to Cloak Room. This implies that at 12:30 AM, the murder weapon was in Gazebo (09). And Mr. Boddy was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM. So this would mean that the weapon was in the same room as Mr. Boddy at 12:30 AM, but he was dead. However, the clue states that the murderer and Mr. Boddy must have been alone in a room with at least one weapon at some point. If the murderer is Professor Plum, and he moved the weapon from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, then he was in Gazebo with the weapon at that time. Since Mr. Boddy was also in Gazebo at 12:30 AM, this would be the time of the murder. Thus, the murder likely happened at 12:30 AM in Gazebo, with Professor Plum as the murderer using the weapon he moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's check this. If the murder happened at 12:30 AM in Gazebo (room 09), then the murderer和Mr. Boddy were there together with the weapon. But how did the murderer get there?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there's a clue: \"Mrs. Peacock was in the Gazebo at 11:30 PM or Mrs. White was in the Kitchen at 12:30 AM.\" We need to check that. But let's focus on the 12:30 AM scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder happened at 12:30 AM in Gazebo, then the murderer is in Gazebo with Mr. Boddy and the weapon. The weapon is whatever was moved by Professor Plum from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM. So the weapon was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM, which is a different weapon. Wait, no—the murder weapon is the weapon used, which is one of the weapons. The murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM. It was then moved, possibly, to Gazebo at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if Professor Plum moved the murder weapon from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, that means the weapon was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM, then moved. So the murder happened before he moved it, possibly. Or he moved it after the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is getting complicated. Let me try to piece it together.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM, then moved to Gazebo at some point before 12:30 AM. Then, at 12:30 AM, Professor Plum moves it from Gazebo to Cloak Room. So the weapon was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM, which is the time when Mr. Boddy was also there. Hence, the murder likely happened at 12:30 AM in Gazebo, with the murderer (Professor Plum) and Mr. Boddy. But this would require that Professor Plum was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM, and moved the weapon from there to Cloak Room after the murder. That makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, if that's the case, then the answer for C would be Gazebo (room 09), D is 12:30 AM, B is whatever the murder weapon is (which was moved from Conservatory to Gazebo), and A is Professor Plum.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let me verify with other clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the clue says that at 12:30 AM, the Cablestick was in the same room as Mrs. Peacock. If Mrs. Peacock was in Gazebo at 12:30 AM (since the Gazebo is room 09), but Mr. Boddy was there, and the murder happened, but she would be there too? Or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the clue says Mrs. Peacock was in Gazebo at 11:30 PM or Mrs. White was in the Kitchen at 12:30 AM. At 11:30 PM, Mrs. Peacock was in the Billiard Room (07), so the first part is false, so the second part must be true: Mrs. White was in the Kitchen (room 10) at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at 12:30 AM, Mrs. White is in Kitchen (room 10). Also, the clue says that a suspect motivated by Pride was in the same room as the Rope at 12:30 AM. So someone motivated by Pride is with the Rope in whatever room they are at 12:30 AM. Also, the Rope was in the Courtyard at 12:30 AM if and only if the Revolver was in the Billiard Room at 11:00 PM. Earlier, we thought that the Revolver was in room 02 (Carriage House) at 11:00 PM, so the Rope would not be in Courtyard at 12:30 AM. But this might not help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there's a clue: \"The Rope was in the Cloak Room at 10:30 PM if and only if the Revolver was in the Billiard Room at 12:00 AM.\" We don't know about the Revolver at 12:00 AM yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "But back to the main theory: the murder occurred at 12:30 AM in Gazebo with Professor Plum using the murder weapon. Let's see if this fits with other clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 12:30 AM, the murder weapon was in Gazebo. Professor Plum moved it from Gazebo to Cloak Room at that time. So the weapon was there when Mr. Boddy was in Gazebo, and Professor Plum was there. This would satisfy the condition of being alone with the weapon and Mr. Boddy. But were they alone? It depends on whether others were in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem says \"the murderer and Mr. Boddy must have been alone in a room with at least one weapon at some point.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So even if others were in the room, as long as the murderer and Mr. Boddy were alone at some point, it's okay. But this is ambiguous. However, the clues might help.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder happened at 12:30 AM in Gazebo, then the only people in the room would be Mr. Boddy and the murderer (Professor Plum), assuming no one else was there. But we don't know. However, at 12:30 AM, Mrs. White is in the Kitchen, and Miss Scarlet moved from Carriage House to Hall at 12:30 AM. Also, Miss Peach was in Carriage House at 12:30 AM or the murder weapon was in Hall at 12:00 AM. Let me check that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue: \"Miss Peach was in the Carriage House at 12:30 AM or the murder weapon was in the Hall at 12:00 AM.\" If the murder weapon was moved to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, then at 12:00 AM it was somewhere else. Let's say it was in the Billiard Room (07) at 12:00 AM. But not sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, this is too many variables. Let's focus on the Professor Plum moving the weapon from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, and the time of the murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder happens at 12:30 AM in Gazebo, then the murderer is Professor Plum, using the murder weapon (which was in Gazebo). The murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM, and then moved to Gazebo via some path.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's check other clues related to Professor Plum. Earlier, we had the clue about the murder weapon being in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM. If the murder weapon was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM, then where was Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder weapon was in the same room as Colonel Mustard at 11:00 PM, and the murder weapon was later in Gazebo, then it's possible that Colonel Mustard was in a room that the weapon moved through, but this is unclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if at 11:00 PM, the murder weapon was with Colonel Mustard, and if the weapon is the one moved from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, then it would have been elsewhere at 11:00 PM. This is getting too abstract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about the motives. The suspects have motives: Pride (2 suspects), Betrayal (3), Ambition (3). We need to determine the motive of the murderer, which is one of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, some clues mention motives. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"A suspect motivated by Pride was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\"\n",

      "- \"A suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Kitchen at 11:30 PM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"A suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Study to the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "- \"A suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Study at 10:30 PM or the Horseshoe was in the Gazebo at 12:30 AM.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "- \"A suspect motivated by Pride was in the Courtyard at 12:00 AM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's assume that the murderer has one of these motives. If the murderer is Professor Plum, what is his motive? We need to determine his motive based on clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's look at the clues about the motives.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 12:00 AM, a suspect motivated by Pride was in the Courtyard. Also, at 11:00 PM, a suspect motivated by Pride was in the Courtyard. At 12:30 AM, a suspect motivated by Pride was in the Billiard Room. Also, at 12:30 AM, a suspect motivated by Pride was in the same room as the Rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me think about this. Let's say that the person motivated by Pride is Miss Peach or someone else. But without knowing who, it's hard to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, let's consider that the murder weapon was moved by Professor Plum at 12:30 AM, so he might have the motive. But this is speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try another approach. Let's look at the clues about the movement of the Wrench and other weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue: \"A suspect motivated by Betrayal moved the Wrench from the Conservatory to the Carriage House at 12:30 AM.\" So at 12:30 AM, a Betrayal-motivated suspect moved the Wrench from Conservatory (03) to Carriage House (02). This suggests that the Wrench was in Conservatory at some time before 12:30 AM, and moved to Carriage House at 12:30 AM. Also, the murder weapon was in Conservatory at 10:30 PM. Is the murder weapon the Wrench? If so, then it was in Conservatory at 10:30 PM, then moved to Gazebo (for the murder at 12:30 AM), then moved to Cloak Room by Professor Plum at 12:30 AM? No, because Professor Plum moved it from Gazebo to Cloak Room at 12:30 AM, and the Wrench was moved to Carriage House at 12:30 AM by a Betrayal suspect. So they are different weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the murder weapon is not the Wrench. It could be another weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM. Let's list possible weapons: Poison, Wrench, Knife, Rope, Horseshoe, Revolver, Lead Pipe, Candlestick. At 10:30 PM, the Knife, Lead Pipe, and Horseshoe were in Cloak Room (08), and the Candlestick was in Billiard Room (07). So the murder weapon must be Poison, Wrench, Revolver, or Rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 12:30 AM, the murder weapon was in Gazebo, moved by Professor Plum. Let's say it's the Revolver, for example. But how to determine?\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue: \"The Revolver and the Candlestick were in the Billiard Room together at least once.\" Since the Candlestick was in Billiard Room at 10:30 PM, if the Revolver was there too, that would satisfy it. But we don't know.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me try to connect this with the earlier clue about the Revolver being in the room just north of Mrs. White at 11:00 PM. If Mrs. White was in the Hall (05) at 11:00 PM, then the Revolver was in Carriage House (02). So the Revolver was in 02 at 11:00 PM. If it was moved to Billiard Room (07) at some later time, it could be with the Candlestick. But this is speculative.\n",

      "At 10:30 PM, Colonel Mustard was in Cloak Room (08). If he moved to, say, the Hall (05) or Billiard Room (07) by 11:00 PM, then the weapon was with him there.

      "Let me think about the movement of the Wrench. A suspect motivated by Betrayal moved the Wrench from the Conservatory to the Carriage House at 12:30 AM. So at 12:30 AM, this person was in Carriage House (02) with the Wrench.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, at 11:30 PM, a suspect motivated by Betrayal moved the Horseshoe from the Conservatory (03) to the Courtyard (06). So this is a different person? Or the same? It could be the same person, but we have 3 suspects with Betrayal motive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's check if Professor Plum is motivated by Ambition or something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue about the Ambition-motivated suspect being in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM: this could be anyone with Ambition motive, like Mr. Green, Professor Plum, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murderer is Professor Plum, and his motive is Ambition, that's possible. Let's see if other clues support this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, \"A suspect motivated by Ambition moved from the Study to the Carriage House at 11:30 PM.\" If this is Professor Plum, then he was in the Study at 11:30 PM, moving to Carriage House.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at 11:30 PM, Mr. Boddy was in Gazebo (09). Let's see if this is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Professor Plum was in Study (01) at 11:30 PM, then moved to Carriage House (02) at 11:30 PM, which is adjacent. This is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is the case, and if Professor Plum is motivated by Ambition, then it fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the clue: \"A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 10:30 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM.\" If Professor Plum was in the Study at 10:30 PM (but at 10:30 PM, he could have been in Hall or elsewhere), this might be complex.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is too much to track. Let me try to summarize:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murderer is Professor Plum, then:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Murder time: 12:30 AM, Gazebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Weapon: whatever was moved from Gazebo to Cloak Room, which was initially in Conservatory at 10:30 PM. Let's assume it's the Wrench. But no, because a Betrayal suspect moved the Wrench at 12:30 AM. So it's a different weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, it could be the Revolver, which was in Carriage House at 11:00 PM (as per the \"room just north of Mrs. White\" clue). If it moved to Gazebo by 12:30 AM, and Professor Plum moved it, then it's possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is still guesswork. Given the complexity, and the clue about the Professor Plum moving the weapon at 12:30 AM, I think the most plausible answer is:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Professor Plum\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Wrench (but no, since a Betrayal suspect moved it at 12:30 AM)\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, no, the Wrench was moved by a Betrayal suspect at 12:30 AM from Conservatory to Carriage House. So it's not the murder weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the murder weapon was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM and moved to Gazebo, it could be the Revolver, Poison, or Rope.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clue: \"The Poison was in the room just north of Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM.\" Let's see where Mrs. Peacock was at 12:00 AM. She was with the Candlestick. If at 12:00 AM, she was in Billiard Room (07), then the Poison was in the room north of 07, which is room 04 (Lounge). So Poison was in room 04 at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is another clue. If the murder weapon is Poison, then it was in room 03 (Conservatory) at 10:30 PM, then moved to room 04 (Lounge) at 12:00 AM, then to Gazebo at 12:30 AM. But this is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to confirm?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the murder weapon is the Poison, and it was in the Conservatory at 10:30 PM, moved to Gazebo at 12:30 AM, then the murderer could have used it to poison Mr. Boddy.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this requires the murderer to have the poison in Gazebo at 12:30 AM. Also, the clue says that the poison was in room just north of Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM. If at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock was in Billiard Room (07), then poison was in 04 (Lounge).\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is speculative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the complexity, and the fact that Professor Plum moved the murder weapon at 12:30 AM, I'll go with Professor Plum as the murderer, with the weapon being the one he moved, and the time and room as Gazebo at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "For motives, if the murderer is Professor Plum, and there is a clue that a suspect motivated by Ambition moved from Study to Carriage House at 11:30 PM, and if that is Professor Plum, then his motive is Ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "So E would be Ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's check for other possible clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Study at 10:30 PM if and only if a suspect motivated by Betrayal was in the Conservatory at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Professor Plum was in the Study at 10:30 PM (assuming he is the one with Ambition motive), then a Betrayal suspect was in Conservatory (03) at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But at 12:00 AM, if the Candlestick is in Billiard Room (07) with Mrs. Peacock, and the Betrayal suspect is in Conservatory (03), that's possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seems to fit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the answers could be:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Professor Plum\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Poison (if it's the weapon moved)\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Gazebo\n",
      "\n",
      "D. 12:30 AM\n",
      "\n",
      "E. Ambition\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to confirm the weapon. Let me see if there's any clue about the murder weapon being Poison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The clue: \"The Poison was in the room just north of Mrs. Peacock at 12:00 AM.\" If at 12:00 AM, Mrs. Peacock is in Billiard Room (07), then Poison is in room 04 (Lounge). If the murder weapon is the Poison, then it was in Conservatory at 10:30 PM, moved to Lounge at 12:00 AM, then to Gazebo at 12:30 AM. This requires movement through rooms, which is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there's no direct evidence. However, this is the only weapon I can think of that might be linked to a clue about where it was at 12:00 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, the murder weapon could be the Revolver, which was in Carriage House at 11:00 PM (room 02) and moved to Gazebo at 12:30 AM.\n",
      "\n",
      "But without more information, it's hard to say. Given the clue about the Poison, I'll go with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, the final answers would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Professor Plum\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Poison\n",
      "\n",

      "For the bonus questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "F. Colonel Mustard's motive: Let's check. There is a clue about Colonel Mustard being in the same room as Horseshoe at 10:30 PM. Also, the motive for him is not directly mentioned, but since there are 3 suspects with Ambition, 3 with Betrayal, 2 with Pride. If Professor Plum is Ambition, then there are 2 left for Ambition, and others. But this requires knowing the other suspects' motives.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is too complex, and I might have to leave it as unknown, but let's think.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are 3 suspects with Ambition, and one is Professor Plum, then two others. If the clue says \"A suspect motivated by Ambition was in the Courtyard at 11:00 PM,\" which could be Mr. Green (since he moved the knife at 12:30 AM and 11:30 PM). But this is too vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the time I've spent and the need to wrap up, I'll proceed with the above answers and try to guess the bonus questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "F. Colonel Mustard's motive: Let's think about clues involving him. He was in the same room as Horseshoe at 10:30 PM, and there's no direct motive clue. Since motives are distributed as 2 Pride, 3 Betrayal, 3 Ambition, and the suspects are 8, it's possible that Colonel Mustard is one of the remaining motives. If we assume that he is not the murderer (Professor Plum), and his motive is not specified, but from the clue about the Wrench being moved by a Betrayal suspect, and other clues, it's possible he is Betrayal. But this is uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "G. Where was the Wrench at 12:00 AM? The clue says a suspect motivated by Betrayal moved it from Conservatory to Carriage House at 12:30 AM. So at 12:00 AM, it was in Conservatory (03).\n",
