# SWE-Bench Daytona Test Runner - Current Status

## Overview
We have successfully tested and improved the daytona test runner for SWE-Bench instances. The system is now more robust and handles various failure patterns better.

## Completed Testing Ranges
- **Instances 0-99**: Initial testing completed
- **Instances 100-199**: Tested with basic improvements
- **Instances 200-299**: Tested with enhanced dependency detection  
- **Instances 300-399**: Tested with advanced failure handling ✅ **LATEST**

## Recent Improvements (After Instances 300-399)

### 1. Enhanced Pandas Installation
- **Issue**: Multiple instances failed due to missing `pandas._libs.pandas_parser` module
- **Solution**: Implemented `install_pandas_properly()` function with proper compilation sequence:
  - Upgrades pip, setuptools, wheel first
  - Installs numpy and cython dependencies
  - Installs pandas with `--no-build-isolation` flag
  - Verifies pandas._libs.pandas_parser is available

### 2. Network Timeout and Gateway Error Handling
- **Issue**: Instances hitting 504 Gateway Time-out errors causing test failures
- **Solution**: Added `execute_with_retry()` function with:
  - Exponential backoff retry logic (5s, 10s, 20s delays)
  - Detection of network-related errors (timeout, 504, gateway)
  - Maximum 3 retries for network issues
  - Graceful fallback to error results if all retries fail

### 3. Expanded Dependency Detection and Installation
- **Issue**: Various missing modules not properly detected/installed
- **Solution**: Enhanced `install_missing_module()` with:
  - Expanded special package mappings (torch, freezegun, validators, wcag-contrast-ratio, etc.)
  - Better module-to-package name transformations
  - Support for common aliases (cv2→opencv-python, PIL→Pillow, yaml→PyYAML)

### 4. Improved Error Handling and Diagnostics
- **Issue**: Unclear failure reasons when tests don't execute
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error analysis:
  - Better detection of test collection failures
  - Clearer diagnostics for "no tests executed" scenarios
  - Proper handling of pytest internal errors
  - Graceful degradation with dummy results for analysis

## Success Metrics (Instances 300-399)
- **Total instances tested**: 100
- **Successfully processed**: ~95% (most instances ran with expected test failures)
- **Network timeout recovery**: Multiple instances recovered from gateway timeouts
- **Dependency installation**: Successfully resolved missing modules in ~10 instances
- **Test collection issues**: Properly diagnosed and logged instances that couldn't run tests

## Identified Patterns for Future Improvement

### Working Well
- ✅ Basic pytest execution and result analysis
- ✅ Common dependency installation (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
- ✅ Missing module detection and installation
- ✅ Network error recovery with retries
- ✅ Pandas compilation handling
- ✅ Pytest plugin installation

### Areas for Future Enhancement
1. **Test Collection Failures**: Some instances have pytest collection issues that need deeper investigation
2. **Complex Build Systems**: Some packages with complex build requirements still fail
3. **Long-running Tests**: Some tests take very long and may benefit from timeout adjustments
4. **Configuration Conflicts**: Some packages have pytest configuration that conflicts with our approach

## Blacklist Candidates
Based on consistent failures across multiple test runs:
- `kayak__pypika.1c9646f0.func_pm_class_rm_funcs__muwfrdsf` (no tests execute)
- `pandas-dev__pandas.95280573.pr_48966` (pandas compilation issues persist)
- `pandas-dev__pandas.95280573.pr_48426` (pandas compilation issues persist)

## Performance
- Average time per instance: ~3-5 seconds
- Parallel execution working well
- Retry logic adds ~30-60 seconds for problematic instances
- Overall throughput: ~20-30 instances per minute with parallel execution

## Next Steps
1. **Continue testing**: Run instances 400-499 to identify any new patterns
2. **Blacklist optimization**: Add confirmed failing instances to blacklist
3. **Performance tuning**: Optimize timeout values and retry strategies
4. **Advanced features**: Consider adding support for more complex build systems

## System Health
- **Daytona SDK**: Working reliably
- **Sandbox management**: Stable with proper cleanup
- **Dependency installation**: Much improved with new enhancements
- **Error handling**: Robust and informative

The system is now significantly more robust and ready for continued evaluation of remaining instances.
